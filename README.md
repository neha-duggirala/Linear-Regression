:one:Cost Functions : ( "Squared error function" or "Mean squared error")
We can measure the accuracy of our hypothesis function by using a cost function.</br>
:two:Gradient Descent:
Gradient Descent is one of the most popular and widely used algorithms for training machine learning models. It is an iterative method. The objective of gradient descent is to find a set of weights (theta) for the model which minimizes the cost function.</br>
